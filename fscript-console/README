FScript Console
===============

This project provides a simple console ("shell") to introspect and
manipulate Fractal architectures using FPath and FScript.

Quick steps to run the console:

1. Make sure the artifacts for the FScript implementation and the
   console itself are installed in your local Maven repository. In the
   parent project, run:

   % mvn install

   This should install fscript-1.0.jar and fscript-console-1.0.jar
   into your Maven repo.

2. Build a self-contained JAR with the console and all its
   dependencies:

   % mvn assembly:assembly

   This creates a JAR in the target/ directory including the console
   and all the required dependencies.

3. Run the application with your target components in the classpath:

  % java -cp myapp.jar:target/fscript-console-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
      org.objectweb.fractal.fscript.console.Console
