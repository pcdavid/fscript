This module contains an extension for FScript to support some Jade-specific
operations. It is implemented as an alternative JadeModel component to replace
the FractalModel component used by default. Use the o.o.f.fscript.FScriptJade
ADL configuration instead of o.o.f.fscript.FScript to use this extension.
