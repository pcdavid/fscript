                               FPath and FScript

Introduction

   FPath is a notation inspired by XPath which makes it easy to navigate
   inside Fractal architectures to discover its strucutre or find
   elements (components or interfaces) which match certain criterions.
   Compared to the direct use of the Fractal APIs, a simple FPath query
   can often replace dozens of lines of Java code.

   FScript is a scripting language dedicated to Fractal components
   architectural reconfigurations. It builds upon FPath but adds the
   possibility to define reconfiguration scripts to modify the
   architecture of a Fractal application. Like FPath, FScript is much
   more concise the direct API usage. In addition, the FScript
   interpreter guarantees that the reconfiguration will finish and is
   atomic: either it is completely and correctly applied, or not at all
   (in case of an error).

Usage

   There are two ways to use FPath and FScript at this time: either
   interactively or programmatically: an API and an interactive console.

   More details are available in the corresponding sections of the
   tutorial (see doc/tutorial.html).
