    <h1>FPath and FScript</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>FPath is a notation inspired by XPath which makes it easy to navigate inside
      Fractal architectures to discover its structure or find elements (components or
      interfaces) which match certain criterions. Compared to the direct use of the
      Fractal APIs, a simple FPath query can often replace dozens of lines of Java
      code.</p>

    <p>FScript is a scripting language dedicated to Fractal components architectural
      reconfigurations. It builds upon FPath but adds the possibility to define
      reconfiguration scripts to modify the architecture of a Fractal application. Like
      FPath, FScript is much more concise the direct API usage. In addition, the FScript
      interpreter guarantees that the reconfiguration will finish and is atomic: either it
      is completely and correctly applied, or not at all (in case of an error).</p>
    
    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>There are two ways to use FPath and FScript at this time: either interactively or
      programmatically: an API and an interactive console.</p>
