  abstract	= {The increasingly diverse and dynamic contexts in which
		  current applications are run imposes them to adapt and to
		  become more \emph{autonomous}. The goal of this thesis is
		  to ease the development of such \emph{self-adaptive
		  applications}, by considering adaptation as an
		  \emph{aspect} which should be defined separately from the
		  rest of the application, so as to be integrated and
		  modified dynamically. To this end we propose SAFRAN, an
		  extension of the Fractal component model enabling dynamic
		  association of adaptation policies to the components of an
		  application. These policies are programed using a
		  Domain-Specific Language in the form of reactive rules.
		  Their execution harnesses WildCAT, a context-awareness
		  system which can detect changes in the execution context
		  (when to adapt?), and FScript, a language dedicated to
		  dynamic and consistent reconfigurations of Fractal
		  components (how to adapt?).},
