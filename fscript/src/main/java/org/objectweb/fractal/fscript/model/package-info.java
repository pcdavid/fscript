/**
 * This package defines an abstract framework which can be used to describe an actual
 * component model (e.g. Fractal). The rest of the FScript 2.0 implementation only
 * manipulates abstractions from this package, and do not depend on the details of
 * the actual model used. Any architectural model which can be modeled as a directed
 * graph with structured nodes and labeled arcs can be modeled in this framework.
